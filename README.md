# Pub Simulator 1.0

**Hello Everyone,**

These bots are written by PLATINUM (Pooya J. also known as PLATINUM_DOTA2).

- You are free to use all of the codes for any non-commercial purposes you choose, with a reference to the original author.
- Do not use any of the files here for any program which is not open source and free to use.
- All the comments made by the bots during the game are for entertainment purposes.

### How to install the bots:
Copy all the files in the `"<steam_dir>\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta\game\dota\scripts\vscripts\bots"` (the location of steam library `<steam_dir>` may differ based on your installation).

You may as well `$ git clone https://github.com/dotobots/bots_PLATINUM_DOTA.git` inside `"<steam_dir>\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta\game\dota\scripts\vscripts"` to get the same result (and later be able to `$ git pull` to update the bots with ease if you're familiar with git).

Note that the "bots" folder doesn't exist by default and you may have to create it.

### How to use the bots:
In order to play with the bots:

- "CREAT LOBBY" in Dota 2
- Open "EDIT" in the "ADVANCED LOBBY SETTINGS"
- Check "FILL EMPTY SLOTS WITH BOTS"
- Select "LOCAL DEV SCRIPT" on either radiant or dire.

I have written bots for 5 heroes (a team), so it is better to select them for one side. However,  you can use them for both radiant or dire, which may be suitable for players who want to play  together in a XvX format (`1 ≤ X ≤4`) in a local host and are missing a few players.

These bots do not change their lanes automatically, so if you want to play with them and change their lanes, you should change the `hero_selection.lua` file (it is not hard to do this, you don't need to know programming to do so).

I hope you enjoy this!
Cheers,
